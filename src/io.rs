 * \page libusb_io Synchronous and asynchronous device I/O
 *
 * \section io_intro Introduction
 *
 * If you're using libusb in your application, you're probably wanting to
 * perform I/O with devices - you want to perform USB data transfers.
 *
 * libusb offers two separate interfaces for device I/O. This page aims to
 * introduce the two in order to help you decide which one is more suitable
 * for your application. You can also choose to use both interfaces in your
 * application by considering each transfer on a case-by-case basis.
 *
 * Once you have read through the following discussion, you should consult the
 * detailed API documentation pages for the details:
 * - \ref libusb_syncio
 * - \ref libusb_asyncio
 *
 * \section theory Transfers at a logical level
 *
 * At a logical level, USB transfers typically happen in two parts. For
 * example, when reading data from a endpoint:
 * -# A request for data is sent to the device
 * -# Some time later, the incoming data is received by the host
 *
 * or when writing data to an endpoint:
 *
 * -# The data is sent to the device
 * -# Some time later, the host receives acknowledgement from the device that
 *    the data has been transferred.
 *
 * There may be an indefinite delay between the two steps. Consider a
 * fictional USB input device with a button that the user can press. In order
 * to determine when the button is pressed, you would likely submit a request
 * to read data on a bulk or interrupt endpoint and wait for data to arrive.
 * Data will arrive when the button is pressed by the user, which is
 * potentially hours later.
 *
 * libusb offers both a synchronous and an asynchronous interface to performing
 * USB transfers. The main difference is that the synchronous interface
 * combines both steps indicated above into a single function call, whereas
 * the asynchronous interface separates them.
 *
 * \section sync The synchronous interface
 *
 * The synchronous I/O interface allows you to perform a USB transfer with
 * a single function call. When the function call returns, the transfer has
 * completed and you can parse the results.
 *
 * If you have used the libusb-0.1 before, this I/O style will seem familar to
 * you. libusb-0.1 only offered a synchronous interface.
 *
 * In our input device example, to read button presses you might write code
 * in the following style:
\code
unsigned char data[4];
int actual_length;
int r = libusb_bulk_transfer(dev_handle, LIBUSB_ENDPOINT_IN, data, sizeof(data), &actual_length, 0);
if (r == 0 && actual_length == sizeof(data)) {
    // results of the transaction can now be found in the data buffer
    // parse them here and report button press
} else {
    error();
}
\endcode
 *
 * The main advantage of this model is simplicity: you did everything with
 * a single simple function call.
 *
 * However, this interface has its limitations. Your application will sleep
 * inside libusb_bulk_transfer() until the transaction has completed. If it
 * takes the user 3 hours to press the button, your application will be
 * sleeping for that long. Execution will be tied up inside the library -
 * the entire thread will be useless for that duration.
 *
 * Another issue is that by tieing up the thread with that single transaction
 * there is no possibility of performing I/O with multiple endpoints and/or
 * multiple devices simultaneously, unless you resort to creating one thread
 * per transaction.
 *
 * Additionally, there is no opportunity to cancel the transfer after the
 * request has been submitted.
 *
 * For details on how to use the synchronous API, see the
 * \ref libusb_syncio "synchronous I/O API documentation" pages.
 *
 * \section async The asynchronous interface
 *
 * Asynchronous I/O is the most significant new feature in libusb-1.0.
 * Although it is a more complex interface, it solves all the issues detailed
 * above.
 *
 * Instead of providing which functions that block until the I/O has complete,
 * libusb's asynchronous interface presents non-blocking functions which
 * begin a transfer and then return immediately. Your application passes a
 * callback function pointer to this non-blocking function, which libusb will
 * call with the results of the transaction when it has completed.
 *
 * Transfers which have been submitted through the non-blocking functions
 * can be cancelled with a separate function call.
 *
 * The non-blocking nature of this interface allows you to be simultaneously
 * performing I/O to multiple endpoints on multiple devices, without having
 * to use threads.
 *
 * This added flexibility does come with some complications though:
 * - In the interest of being a lightweight library, libusb does not create
 * threads and can only operate when your application is calling into it. Your
 * application must call into libusb from it's main loop when events are ready
 * to be handled, or you must use some other scheme to allow libusb to
 * undertake whatever work needs to be done.
 * - libusb also needs to be called into at certain fixed points in time in
 * order to accurately handle transfer timeouts.
 * - Memory handling becomes more complex. You cannot use stack memory unless
 * the function with that stack is guaranteed not to return until the transfer
 * callback has finished executing.
 * - You generally lose some linearity from your code flow because submitting
 * the transfer request is done in a separate function from where the transfer
 * results are handled. This becomes particularly obvious when you want to
 * submit a second transfer based on the results of an earlier transfer.
 *
 * Internally, libusb's synchronous interface is expressed in terms of function
 * calls to the asynchronous interface.
 *
 * For details on how to use the asynchronous API, see the
 * \ref libusb_asyncio "asynchronous I/O API" documentation pages.

/* *
 * \page libusb_packetoverflow Packets and overflows
 *
 * \section packets Packet abstraction
 *
 * The USB specifications describe how data is transmitted in packets, with
 * constraints on packet size defined by endpoint descriptors. The host must
 * not send data payloads larger than the endpoint's maximum packet size.
 *
 * libusb and the underlying OS abstract out the packet concept, allowing you
 * to request transfers of any size. Internally, the request will be divided
 * up into correctly-sized packets. You do not have to be concerned with
 * packet sizes, but there is one exception when considering overflows.
 *
 * \section overflow Bulk/interrupt transfer overflows
 *
 * When requesting data on a bulk endpoint, libusb requires you to supply a
 * buffer and the maximum number of bytes of data that libusb can put in that
 * buffer. However, the size of the buffer is not communicated to the device -
 * the device is just asked to send any amount of data.
 *
 * There is no problem if the device sends an amount of data that is less than
 * or equal to the buffer size. libusb reports this condition to you through
 * the \ref libusb_transfer::actual_length "libusb_transfer.actual_length"
 * field.
 *
 * Problems may occur if the device attempts to send more data than can fit in
 * the buffer. libusb reports LIBUSB_TRANSFER_OVERFLOW for this condition but
 * other behaviour is largely undefined: actual_length may or may not be
 * accurate, the chunk of data that can fit in the buffer (before overflow)
 * may or may not have been transferred.
 *
 * Overflows are nasty, but can be avoided. Even though you were told to
 * ignore packets above, think about the lower level details: each transfer is
 * split into packets (typically small, with a maximum size of 512 bytes).
 * Overflows can only happen if the final packet in an incoming data transfer
 * is smaller than the actual packet that the device wants to transfer.
 * Therefore, you will never see an overflow if your transfer buffer size is a
 * multiple of the endpoint's packet size: the final packet will either
 * fill up completely or will be only partially filled.
 */
/* *
 * @defgroup libusb_asyncio Asynchronous device I/O
 *
 * This page details libusb's asynchronous (non-blocking) API for USB device
 * I/O. This interface is very powerful but is also quite complex - you will
 * need to read this page carefully to understand the necessary considerations
 * and issues surrounding use of this interface. Simplistic applications
 * may wish to consider the \ref libusb_syncio "synchronous I/O API" instead.
 *
 * The asynchronous interface is built around the idea of separating transfer
 * submission and handling of transfer completion (the synchronous model
 * combines both of these into one). There may be a long delay between
 * submission and completion, however the asynchronous submission function
 * is non-blocking so will return control to your application during that
 * potentially long delay.
 *
 * \section asyncabstraction Transfer abstraction
 *
 * For the asynchronous I/O, libusb implements the concept of a generic
 * transfer entity for all types of I/O (control, bulk, interrupt,
 * isochronous). The generic transfer object must be treated slightly
 * differently depending on which type of I/O you are performing with it.
 *
 * This is represented by the public libusb_transfer structure type.
 *
 * \section asynctrf Asynchronous transfers
 *
 * We can view asynchronous I/O as a 5 step process:
 * -# <b>Allocation</b>: allocate a libusb_transfer
 * -# <b>Filling</b>: populate the libusb_transfer instance with information
 *    about the transfer you wish to perform
 * -# <b>Submission</b>: ask libusb to submit the transfer
 * -# <b>Completion handling</b>: examine transfer results in the
 *    libusb_transfer structure
 * -# <b>Deallocation</b>: clean up resources
 *
 *
 * \subsection asyncalloc Allocation
 *
 * This step involves allocating memory for a USB transfer. This is the
 * generic transfer object mentioned above. At this stage, the transfer
 * is "blank" with no details about what type of I/O it will be used for.
 *
 * Allocation is done with the libusb_alloc_transfer() function. You must use
 * this function rather than allocating your own transfers.
 *
 * \subsection asyncfill Filling
 *
 * This step is where you take a previously allocated transfer and fill it
 * with information to determine the message type and direction, data buffer,
 * callback function, etc.
 *
 * You can either fill the required fields yourself or you can use the
 * helper functions: libusb_fill_control_transfer(), libusb_fill_bulk_transfer()
 * and libusb_fill_interrupt_transfer().
 *
 * \subsection asyncsubmit Submission
 *
 * When you have allocated a transfer and filled it, you can submit it using
 * libusb_submit_transfer(). This function returns immediately but can be
 * regarded as firing off the I/O request in the background.
 *
 * \subsection asynccomplete Completion handling
 *
 * After a transfer has been submitted, one of four things can happen to it:
 *
 * - The transfer completes (i.e. some data was transferred)
 * - The transfer has a timeout and the timeout expires before all data is
 * transferred
 * - The transfer fails due to an error
 * - The transfer is cancelled
 *
 * Each of these will cause the user-specified transfer callback function to
 * be invoked. It is up to the callback function to determine which of the
 * above actually happened and to act accordingly.
 *
 * The user-specified callback is passed a pointer to the libusb_transfer
 * structure which was used to setup and submit the transfer. At completion
 * time, libusb has populated this structure with results of the transfer:
 * success or failure reason, number of bytes of data transferred, etc. See
 * the libusb_transfer structure documentation for more information.
 *
 * <b>Important Note</b>: The user-specified callback is called from an event
 * handling context. It is therefore important that no calls are made into
 * libusb that will attempt to perform any event handling. Examples of such
 * functions are any listed in the \ref libusb_syncio "synchronous API" and any of
 * the blocking functions that retrieve \ref libusb_desc "USB descriptors".
 *
 * \subsection Deallocation
 *
 * When a transfer has completed (i.e. the callback function has been invoked),
 * you are advised to free the transfer (unless you wish to resubmit it, see
 * below). Transfers are deallocated with libusb_free_transfer().
 *
 * It is undefined behaviour to free a transfer which has not completed.
 *
 * \section asyncresubmit Resubmission
 *
 * You may be wondering why allocation, filling, and submission are all
 * separated above where they could reasonably be combined into a single
 * operation.
 *
 * The reason for separation is to allow you to resubmit transfers without
 * having to allocate new ones every time. This is especially useful for
 * common situations dealing with interrupt endpoints - you allocate one
 * transfer, fill and submit it, and when it returns with results you just
 * resubmit it for the next interrupt.
 *
 * \section asynccancel Cancellation
 *
 * Another advantage of using the asynchronous interface is that you have
 * the ability to cancel transfers which have not yet completed. This is
 * done by calling the libusb_cancel_transfer() function.
 *
 * libusb_cancel_transfer() is asynchronous/non-blocking in itself. When the
 * cancellation actually completes, the transfer's callback function will
 * be invoked, and the callback function should check the transfer status to
 * determine that it was cancelled.
 *
 * Freeing the transfer after it has been cancelled but before cancellation
 * has completed will result in undefined behaviour.
 *
 * When a transfer is cancelled, some of the data may have been transferred.
 * libusb will communicate this to you in the transfer callback. Do not assume
 * that no data was transferred.
 *
 * \section bulk_overflows Overflows on device-to-host bulk/interrupt endpoints
 *
 * If your device does not have predictable transfer sizes (or it misbehaves),
 * your application may submit a request for data on an IN endpoint which is
 * smaller than the data that the device wishes to send. In some circumstances
 * this will cause an overflow, which is a nasty condition to deal with. See
 * the \ref libusb_packetoverflow page for discussion.
 *
 * \section asyncctrl Considerations for control transfers
 *
 * The <tt>libusb_transfer</tt> structure is generic and hence does not
 * include specific fields for the control-specific setup packet structure.
 *
 * In order to perform a control transfer, you must place the 8-byte setup
 * packet at the start of the data buffer. To simplify this, you could
 * cast the buffer pointer to type struct libusb_control_setup, or you can
 * use the helper function libusb_fill_control_setup().
 *
 * The wLength field placed in the setup packet must be the length you would
 * expect to be sent in the setup packet: the length of the payload that
 * follows (or the expected maximum number of bytes to receive). However,
 * the length field of the libusb_transfer object must be the length of
 * the data buffer - i.e. it should be wLength <em>plus</em> the size of
 * the setup packet (LIBUSB_CONTROL_SETUP_SIZE).
 *
 * If you use the helper functions, this is simplified for you:
 * -# Allocate a buffer of size LIBUSB_CONTROL_SETUP_SIZE plus the size of the
 * data you are sending/requesting.
 * -# Call libusb_fill_control_setup() on the data buffer, using the transfer
 * request size as the wLength value (i.e. do not include the extra space you
 * allocated for the control setup).
 * -# If this is a host-to-device transfer, place the data to be transferred
 * in the data buffer, starting at offset LIBUSB_CONTROL_SETUP_SIZE.
 * -# Call libusb_fill_control_transfer() to associate the data buffer with
 * the transfer (and to set the remaining details such as callback and timeout).
 *   - Note that there is no parameter to set the length field of the transfer.
 *     The length is automatically inferred from the wLength field of the setup
 *     packet.
 * -# Submit the transfer.
 *
 * The multi-byte control setup fields (wValue, wIndex and wLength) must
 * be given in little-endian byte order (the endianness of the USB bus).
 * Endianness conversion is transparently handled by
 * libusb_fill_control_setup() which is documented to accept host-endian
 * values.
 *
 * Further considerations are needed when handling transfer completion in
 * your callback function:
 * - As you might expect, the setup packet will still be sitting at the start
 * of the data buffer.
 * - If this was a device-to-host transfer, the received data will be sitting
 * at offset LIBUSB_CONTROL_SETUP_SIZE into the buffer.
 * - The actual_length field of the transfer structure is relative to the
 * wLength of the setup packet, rather than the size of the data buffer. So,
 * if your wLength was 4, your transfer's <tt>length</tt> was 12, then you
 * should expect an <tt>actual_length</tt> of 4 to indicate that the data was
 * transferred in entirity.
 *
 * To simplify parsing of setup packets and obtaining the data from the
 * correct offset, you may wish to use the libusb_control_transfer_get_data()
 * and libusb_control_transfer_get_setup() functions within your transfer
 * callback.
 *
 * Even though control endpoints do not halt, a completed control transfer
 * may have a LIBUSB_TRANSFER_STALL status code. This indicates the control
 * request was not supported.
 *
 * \section asyncintr Considerations for interrupt transfers
 *
 * All interrupt transfers are performed using the polling interval presented
 * by the bInterval value of the endpoint descriptor.
 *
 * \section asynciso Considerations for isochronous transfers
 *
 * Isochronous transfers are more complicated than transfers to
 * non-isochronous endpoints.
 *
 * To perform I/O to an isochronous endpoint, allocate the transfer by calling
 * libusb_alloc_transfer() with an appropriate number of isochronous packets.
 *
 * During filling, set \ref libusb_transfer::type "type" to
 * \ref libusb_transfer_type::LIBUSB_TRANSFER_TYPE_ISOCHRONOUS
 * "LIBUSB_TRANSFER_TYPE_ISOCHRONOUS", and set
 * \ref libusb_transfer::num_iso_packets "num_iso_packets" to a value less than
 * or equal to the number of packets you requested during allocation.
 * libusb_alloc_transfer() does not set either of these fields for you, given
 * that you might not even use the transfer on an isochronous endpoint.
 *
 * Next, populate the length field for the first num_iso_packets entries in
 * the \ref libusb_transfer::iso_packet_desc "iso_packet_desc" array. Section
 * 5.6.3 of the USB2 specifications describe how the maximum isochronous
 * packet length is determined by the wMaxPacketSize field in the endpoint
 * descriptor.
 * Two functions can help you here:
 *
 * - libusb_get_max_iso_packet_size() is an easy way to determine the max
 *   packet size for an isochronous endpoint. Note that the maximum packet
 *   size is actually the maximum number of bytes that can be transmitted in
 *   a single microframe, therefore this function multiplies the maximum number
 *   of bytes per transaction by the number of transaction opportunities per
 *   microframe.
 * - libusb_set_iso_packet_lengths() assigns the same length to all packets
 *   within a transfer, which is usually what you want.
 *
 * For outgoing transfers, you'll obviously fill the buffer and populate the
 * packet descriptors in hope that all the data gets transferred. For incoming
 * transfers, you must ensure the buffer has sufficient capacity for
 * the situation where all packets transfer the full amount of requested data.
 *
 * Completion handling requires some extra consideration. The
 * \ref libusb_transfer::actual_length "actual_length" field of the transfer
 * is meaningless and should not be examined; instead you must refer to the
 * \ref libusb_iso_packet_descriptor::actual_length "actual_length" field of
 * each individual packet.
 *
 * The \ref libusb_transfer::status "status" field of the transfer is also a
 * little misleading:
 *  - If the packets were submitted and the isochronous data microframes
 *    completed normally, status will have value
 *    \ref libusb_transfer_status::LIBUSB_TRANSFER_COMPLETED
 *    "LIBUSB_TRANSFER_COMPLETED". Note that bus errors and software-incurred
 *    delays are not counted as transfer errors; the transfer.status field may
 *    indicate COMPLETED even if some or all of the packets failed. Refer to
 *    the \ref libusb_iso_packet_descriptor::status "status" field of each
 *    individual packet to determine packet failures.
 *  - The status field will have value
 *    \ref libusb_transfer_status::LIBUSB_TRANSFER_ERROR
 *    "LIBUSB_TRANSFER_ERROR" only when serious errors were encountered.
 *  - Other transfer status codes occur with normal behaviour.
 *
 * The data for each packet will be found at an offset into the buffer that
 * can be calculated as if each prior packet completed in full. The
 * libusb_get_iso_packet_buffer() and libusb_get_iso_packet_buffer_simple()
 * functions may help you here.
 *
 * <b>Note</b>: Some operating systems (e.g. Linux) may impose limits on the
 * length of individual isochronous packets and/or the total length of the
 * isochronous transfer. Such limits can be difficult for libusb to detect,
 * so the library will simply try and submit the transfer as set up by you.
 * If the transfer fails to submit because it is too large,
 * libusb_submit_transfer() will return
 * \ref libusb_error::LIBUSB_ERROR_INVALID_PARAM "LIBUSB_ERROR_INVALID_PARAM".
 *
 * \section asyncmem Memory caveats
 *
 * In most circumstances, it is not safe to use stack memory for transfer
 * buffers. This is because the function that fired off the asynchronous
 * transfer may return before libusb has finished using the buffer, and when
 * the function returns it's stack gets destroyed. This is true for both
 * host-to-device and device-to-host transfers.
 *
 * The only case in which it is safe to use stack memory is where you can
 * guarantee that the function owning the stack space for the buffer does not
 * return until after the transfer's callback function has completed. In every
 * other case, you need to use heap memory instead.
 *
 * \section asyncflags Fine control
 *
 * Through using this asynchronous interface, you may find yourself repeating
 * a few simple operations many times. You can apply a bitwise OR of certain
 * flags to a transfer to simplify certain things:
 * - \ref libusb_transfer_flags::LIBUSB_TRANSFER_SHORT_NOT_OK
 *   "LIBUSB_TRANSFER_SHORT_NOT_OK" results in transfers which transferred
 *   less than the requested amount of data being marked with status
 *   \ref libusb_transfer_status::LIBUSB_TRANSFER_ERROR "LIBUSB_TRANSFER_ERROR"
 *   (they would normally be regarded as COMPLETED)
 * - \ref libusb_transfer_flags::LIBUSB_TRANSFER_FREE_BUFFER
 *   "LIBUSB_TRANSFER_FREE_BUFFER" allows you to ask libusb to free the transfer
 *   buffer when freeing the transfer.
 * - \ref libusb_transfer_flags::LIBUSB_TRANSFER_FREE_TRANSFER
 *   "LIBUSB_TRANSFER_FREE_TRANSFER" causes libusb to automatically free the
 *   transfer after the transfer callback returns.
 *
 * \section asyncevent Event handling
 *
 * An asynchronous model requires that libusb perform work at various
 * points in time - namely processing the results of previously-submitted
 * transfers and invoking the user-supplied callback function.
 *
 * This gives rise to the libusb_handle_events() function which your
 * application must call into when libusb has work do to. This gives libusb
 * the opportunity to reap pending transfers, invoke callbacks, etc.
 *
 * There are 2 different approaches to dealing with libusb_handle_events:
 *
 * -# Repeatedly call libusb_handle_events() in blocking mode from a dedicated
 *    thread.
 * -# Integrate libusb with your application's main event loop. libusb
 *    exposes a set of file descriptors which allow you to do this.
 *
 * The first approach has the big advantage that it will also work on Windows
 * were libusb' poll API for select / poll integration is not available. So
 * if you want to support Windows and use the async API, you must use this
 * approach, see the \ref eventthread "Using an event handling thread" section
 * below for details.
 *
 * If you prefer a single threaded approach with a single central event loop,
 * see the \ref libusb_poll "polling and timing" section for how to integrate libusb
 * into your application's main event loop.
 *
 * \section eventthread Using an event handling thread
 *
 * Lets begin with stating the obvious: If you're going to use a separate
 * thread for libusb event handling, your callback functions MUST be
 * threadsafe.
 *
 * Other then that doing event handling from a separate thread, is mostly
 * simple. You can use an event thread function as follows:
\code
void *event_thread_func(void *ctx)
{
    while (event_thread_run)
        libusb_handle_events(ctx);

    return NULL;
}
\endcode
 *
 * There is one caveat though, stopping this thread requires setting the
 * event_thread_run variable to 0, and after that libusb_handle_events() needs
 * to return control to event_thread_func. But unless some event happens,
 * libusb_handle_events() will not return.
 *
 * There are 2 different ways of dealing with this, depending on if your
 * application uses libusb' \ref libusb_hotplug "hotplug" support or not.
 *
 * Applications which do not use hotplug support, should not start the event
 * thread until after their first call to libusb_open(), and should stop the
 * thread when closing the last open device as follows:
\code
void my_close_handle(libusb_device_handle *dev_handle)
{
    if (open_devs == 1)
        event_thread_run = 0;

    libusb_close(dev_handle); // This wakes up libusb_handle_events()

    if (open_devs == 1)
        pthread_join(event_thread);

    open_devs--;
}
\endcode
 *
 * Applications using hotplug support should start the thread at program init,
 * after having successfully called libusb_hotplug_register_callback(), and
 * should stop the thread at program exit as follows:
\code
void my_libusb_exit(void)
{
    event_thread_run = 0;
    libusb_hotplug_deregister_callback(ctx, hotplug_cb_handle); // This wakes up libusb_handle_events()
    pthread_join(event_thread);
    libusb_exit(ctx);
}
\endcode
 */
/* *
 * @defgroup libusb_poll Polling and timing
 *
 * This page documents libusb's functions for polling events and timing.
 * These functions are only necessary for users of the
 * \ref libusb_asyncio "asynchronous API". If you are only using the simpler
 * \ref libusb_syncio "synchronous API" then you do not need to ever call these
 * functions.
 *
 * The justification for the functionality described here has already been
 * discussed in the \ref asyncevent "event handling" section of the
 * asynchronous API documentation. In summary, libusb does not create internal
 * threads for event processing and hence relies on your application calling
 * into libusb at certain points in time so that pending events can be handled.
 *
 * Your main loop is probably already calling poll() or select() or a
 * variant on a set of file descriptors for other event sources (e.g. keyboard
 * button presses, mouse movements, network sockets, etc). You then add
 * libusb's file descriptors to your poll()/select() calls, and when activity
 * is detected on such descriptors you know it is time to call
 * libusb_handle_events().
 *
 * There is one final event handling complication. libusb supports
 * asynchronous transfers which time out after a specified time period.
 *
 * On some platforms a timerfd is used, so the timeout handling is just another
 * fd, on other platforms this requires that libusb is called into at or after
 * the timeout to handle it. So, in addition to considering libusb's file
 * descriptors in your main event loop, you must also consider that libusb
 * sometimes needs to be called into at fixed points in time even when there
 * is no file descriptor activity, see \ref polltime details.
 *
 * In order to know precisely when libusb needs to be called into, libusb
 * offers you a set of pollable file descriptors and information about when
 * the next timeout expires.
 *
 * If you are using the asynchronous I/O API, you must take one of the two
 * following options, otherwise your I/O will not complete.
 *
 * \section pollsimple The simple option
 *
 * If your application revolves solely around libusb and does not need to
 * handle other event sources, you can have a program structure as follows:
\code
// initialize libusb
// find and open device
// maybe fire off some initial async I/O

while (user_has_not_requested_exit)
    libusb_handle_events(ctx);

// clean up and exit
\endcode
 *
 * With such a simple main loop, you do not have to worry about managing
 * sets of file descriptors or handling timeouts. libusb_handle_events() will
 * handle those details internally.
 *
 * \section libusb_pollmain The more advanced option
 *
 * \note This functionality is currently only available on Unix-like platforms.
 * On Windows, libusb_get_pollfds() simply returns NULL. Applications which
 * want to support Windows are advised to use an \ref eventthread
 * "event handling thread" instead.
 *
 * In more advanced applications, you will already have a main loop which
 * is monitoring other event sources: network sockets, X11 events, mouse
 * movements, etc. Through exposing a set of file descriptors, libusb is
 * designed to cleanly integrate into such main loops.
 *
 * In addition to polling file descriptors for the other event sources, you
 * take a set of file descriptors from libusb and monitor those too. When you
 * detect activity on libusb's file descriptors, you call
 * libusb_handle_events_timeout() in non-blocking mode.
 *
 * What's more, libusb may also need to handle events at specific moments in
 * time. No file descriptor activity is generated at these times, so your
 * own application needs to be continually aware of when the next one of these
 * moments occurs (through calling libusb_get_next_timeout()), and then it
 * needs to call libusb_handle_events_timeout() in non-blocking mode when
 * these moments occur. This means that you need to adjust your
 * poll()/select() timeout accordingly.
 *
 * libusb provides you with a set of file descriptors to poll and expects you
 * to poll all of them, treating them as a single entity. The meaning of each
 * file descriptor in the set is an internal implementation detail,
 * platform-dependent and may vary from release to release. Don't try and
 * interpret the meaning of the file descriptors, just do as libusb indicates,
 * polling all of them at once.
 *
 * In pseudo-code, you want something that looks like:
\code
// initialise libusb

libusb_get_pollfds(ctx)
while (user has not requested application exit) {
    libusb_get_next_timeout(ctx);
    poll(on libusb file descriptors plus any other event sources of interest,
        using a timeout no larger than the value libusb just suggested)
    if (poll() indicated activity on libusb file descriptors)
        libusb_handle_events_timeout(ctx, &zero_tv);
    if (time has elapsed to or beyond the libusb timeout)
        libusb_handle_events_timeout(ctx, &zero_tv);
    // handle events from other sources here
}

// clean up and exit
\endcode
 *
 * \subsection polltime Notes on time-based events
 *
 * The above complication with having to track time and call into libusb at
 * specific moments is a bit of a headache. For maximum compatibility, you do
 * need to write your main loop as above, but you may decide that you can
 * restrict the supported platforms of your application and get away with
 * a more simplistic scheme.
 *
 * These time-based event complications are \b not required on the following
 * platforms:
 *  - Darwin
 *  - Linux, provided that the following version requirements are satisfied:
 *   - Linux v2.6.27 or newer, compiled with timerfd support
 *   - glibc v2.9 or newer
 *   - libusb v1.0.5 or newer
 *
 * Under these configurations, libusb_get_next_timeout() will \em always return
 * 0, so your main loop can be simplified to:
\code
// initialise libusb

libusb_get_pollfds(ctx)
while (user has not requested application exit) {
    poll(on libusb file descriptors plus any other event sources of interest,
        using any timeout that you like)
    if (poll() indicated activity on libusb file descriptors)
        libusb_handle_events_timeout(ctx, &zero_tv);
    // handle events from other sources here
}

// clean up and exit
\endcode
 *
 * Do remember that if you simplify your main loop to the above, you will
 * lose compatibility with some platforms (including legacy Linux platforms,
 * and <em>any future platforms supported by libusb which may have time-based
 * event requirements</em>). The resultant problems will likely appear as
 * strange bugs in your application.
 *
 * You can use the libusb_pollfds_handle_timeouts() function to do a runtime
 * check to see if it is safe to ignore the time-based event complications.
 * If your application has taken the shortcut of ignoring libusb's next timeout
 * in your main loop, then you are advised to check the return value of
 * libusb_pollfds_handle_timeouts() during application startup, and to abort
 * if the platform does suffer from these timing complications.
 *
 * \subsection fdsetchange Changes in the file descriptor set
 *
 * The set of file descriptors that libusb uses as event sources may change
 * during the life of your application. Rather than having to repeatedly
 * call libusb_get_pollfds(), you can set up notification functions for when
 * the file descriptor set changes using libusb_set_pollfd_notifiers().
 *
 * \subsection mtissues Multi-threaded considerations
 *
 * Unfortunately, the situation is complicated further when multiple threads
 * come into play. If two threads are monitoring the same file descriptors,
 * the fact that only one thread will be woken up when an event occurs causes
 * some headaches.
 *
 * The events lock, event waiters lock, and libusb_handle_events_locked()
 * entities are added to solve these problems. You do not need to be concerned
 * with these entities otherwise.
 *
 * See the extra documentation: \ref libusb_mtasync
 */
/* * \page libusb_mtasync Multi-threaded applications and asynchronous I/O
 *
 * libusb is a thread-safe library, but extra considerations must be applied
 * to applications which interact with libusb from multiple threads.
 *
 * The underlying issue that must be addressed is that all libusb I/O
 * revolves around monitoring file descriptors through the poll()/select()
 * system calls. This is directly exposed at the
 * \ref libusb_asyncio "asynchronous interface" but it is important to note that the
 * \ref libusb_syncio "synchronous interface" is implemented on top of the
 * asynchonrous interface, therefore the same considerations apply.
 *
 * The issue is that if two or more threads are concurrently calling poll()
 * or select() on libusb's file descriptors then only one of those threads
 * will be woken up when an event arrives. The others will be completely
 * oblivious that anything has happened.
 *
 * Consider the following pseudo-code, which submits an asynchronous transfer
 * then waits for its completion. This style is one way you could implement a
 * synchronous interface on top of the asynchronous interface (and libusb
 * does something similar, albeit more advanced due to the complications
 * explained on this page).
 *
\code
void cb(struct libusb_transfer *transfer)
{
    int *completed = transfer->user_data;
    *completed = 1;
}

void myfunc() {
    struct libusb_transfer *transfer;
    unsigned char buffer[LIBUSB_CONTROL_SETUP_SIZE] __attribute__ ((aligned (2)));
    int completed = 0;

    transfer = libusb_alloc_transfer(0);
    libusb_fill_control_setup(buffer,
        LIBUSB_REQUEST_TYPE_VENDOR | LIBUSB_ENDPOINT_OUT, 0x04, 0x01, 0, 0);
    libusb_fill_control_transfer(transfer, dev, buffer, cb, &completed, 1000);
    libusb_submit_transfer(transfer);

    while (!completed) {
        poll(libusb file descriptors, 120*1000);
        if (poll indicates activity)
            libusb_handle_events_timeout(ctx, &zero_tv);
    }
    printf("completed!");
    // other code here
}
\endcode
 *
 * Here we are <em>serializing</em> completion of an asynchronous event
 * against a condition - the condition being completion of a specific transfer.
 * The poll() loop has a long timeout to minimize CPU usage during situations
 * when nothing is happening (it could reasonably be unlimited).
 *
 * If this is the only thread that is polling libusb's file descriptors, there
 * is no problem: there is no danger that another thread will swallow up the
 * event that we are interested in. On the other hand, if there is another
 * thread polling the same descriptors, there is a chance that it will receive
 * the event that we were interested in. In this situation, <tt>myfunc()</tt>
 * will only realise that the transfer has completed on the next iteration of
 * the loop, <em>up to 120 seconds later.</em> Clearly a two-minute delay is
 * undesirable, and don't even think about using short timeouts to circumvent
 * this issue!
 *
 * The solution here is to ensure that no two threads are ever polling the
 * file descriptors at the same time. A naive implementation of this would
 * impact the capabilities of the library, so libusb offers the scheme
 * documented below to ensure no loss of functionality.
 *
 * Before we go any further, it is worth mentioning that all libusb-wrapped
 * event handling procedures fully adhere to the scheme documented below.
 * This includes libusb_handle_events() and its variants, and all the
 * synchronous I/O functions - libusb hides this headache from you.
 *
 * \section Using libusb_handle_events() from multiple threads
 *
 * Even when only using libusb_handle_events() and synchronous I/O functions,
 * you can still have a race condition. You might be tempted to solve the
 * above with libusb_handle_events() like so:
 *
\code
    libusb_submit_transfer(transfer);

    while (!completed) {
        libusb_handle_events(ctx);
    }
    printf("completed!");
\endcode
 *
 * This however has a race between the checking of completed and
 * libusb_handle_events() acquiring the events lock, so another thread
 * could have completed the transfer, resulting in this thread hanging
 * until either a timeout or another event occurs. See also commit
 * 6696512aade99bb15d6792af90ae329af270eba6 which fixes this in the
 * synchronous API implementation of libusb.
 *
 * Fixing this race requires checking the variable completed only after
 * taking the event lock, which defeats the concept of just calling
 * libusb_handle_events() without worrying about locking. This is why
 * libusb-1.0.9 introduces the new libusb_handle_events_timeout_completed()
 * and libusb_handle_events_completed() functions, which handles doing the
 * completion check for you after they have acquired the lock:
 *
\code
    libusb_submit_transfer(transfer);

    while (!completed) {
        libusb_handle_events_completed(ctx, &completed);
    }
    printf("completed!");
\endcode
 *
 * This nicely fixes the race in our example. Note that if all you want to
 * do is submit a single transfer and wait for its completion, then using
 * one of the synchronous I/O functions is much easier.
 *
 * \section eventlock The events lock
 *
 * The problem is when we consider the fact that libusb exposes file
 * descriptors to allow for you to integrate asynchronous USB I/O into
 * existing main loops, effectively allowing you to do some work behind
 * libusb's back. If you do take libusb's file descriptors and pass them to
 * poll()/select() yourself, you need to be aware of the associated issues.
 *
 * The first concept to be introduced is the events lock. The events lock
 * is used to serialize threads that want to handle events, such that only
 * one thread is handling events at any one time.
 *
 * You must take the events lock before polling libusb file descriptors,
 * using libusb_lock_events(). You must release the lock as soon as you have
 * aborted your poll()/select() loop, using libusb_unlock_events().
 *
 * \section threadwait Letting other threads do the work for you
 *
 * Although the events lock is a critical part of the solution, it is not
 * enough on it's own. You might wonder if the following is sufficient...
\code
    libusb_lock_events(ctx);
    while (!completed) {
        poll(libusb file descriptors, 120*1000);
        if (poll indicates activity)
            libusb_handle_events_timeout(ctx, &zero_tv);
    }
    libusb_unlock_events(ctx);
\endcode
 * ...and the answer is that it is not. This is because the transfer in the
 * code shown above may take a long time (say 30 seconds) to complete, and
 * the lock is not released until the transfer is completed.
 *
 * Another thread with similar code that wants to do event handling may be
 * working with a transfer that completes after a few milliseconds. Despite
 * having such a quick completion time, the other thread cannot check that
 * status of its transfer until the code above has finished (30 seconds later)
 * due to contention on the lock.
 *
 * To solve this, libusb offers you a mechanism to determine when another
 * thread is handling events. It also offers a mechanism to block your thread
 * until the event handling thread has completed an event (and this mechanism
 * does not involve polling of file descriptors).
 *
 * After determining that another thread is currently handling events, you
 * obtain the <em>event waiters</em> lock using libusb_lock_event_waiters().
 * You then re-check that some other thread is still handling events, and if
 * so, you call libusb_wait_for_event().
 *
 * libusb_wait_for_event() puts your application to sleep until an event
 * occurs, or until a thread releases the events lock. When either of these
 * things happen, your thread is woken up, and should re-check the condition
 * it was waiting on. It should also re-check that another thread is handling
 * events, and if not, it should start handling events itself.
 *
 * This looks like the following, as pseudo-code:
\code
retry:
if (libusb_try_lock_events(ctx) == 0) {
    // we obtained the event lock: do our own event handling
    while (!completed) {
        if (!libusb_event_handling_ok(ctx)) {
            libusb_unlock_events(ctx);
            goto retry;
        }
        poll(libusb file descriptors, 120*1000);
        if (poll indicates activity)
            libusb_handle_events_locked(ctx, 0);
    }
    libusb_unlock_events(ctx);
} else {
    // another thread is doing event handling. wait for it to signal us that
    // an event has completed
    libusb_lock_event_waiters(ctx);

    while (!completed) {
        // now that we have the event waiters lock, double check that another
        // thread is still handling events for us. (it may have ceased handling
        // events in the time it took us to reach this point)
        if (!libusb_event_handler_active(ctx)) {
            // whoever was handling events is no longer doing so, try again
            libusb_unlock_event_waiters(ctx);
            goto retry;
        }

        libusb_wait_for_event(ctx, NULL);
    }
    libusb_unlock_event_waiters(ctx);
}
printf("completed!\n");
\endcode
 *
 * A naive look at the above code may suggest that this can only support
 * one event waiter (hence a total of 2 competing threads, the other doing
 * event handling), because the event waiter seems to have taken the event
 * waiters lock while waiting for an event. However, the system does support
 * multiple event waiters, because libusb_wait_for_event() actually drops
 * the lock while waiting, and reaquires it before continuing.
 *
 * We have now implemented code which can dynamically handle situations where
 * nobody is handling events (so we should do it ourselves), and it can also
 * handle situations where another thread is doing event handling (so we can
 * piggyback onto them). It is also equipped to handle a combination of
 * the two, for example, another thread is doing event handling, but for
 * whatever reason it stops doing so before our condition is met, so we take
 * over the event handling.
 *
 * Four functions were introduced in the above pseudo-code. Their importance
 * should be apparent from the code shown above.
 * -# libusb_try_lock_events() is a non-blocking function which attempts
 *    to acquire the events lock but returns a failure code if it is contended.
 * -# libusb_event_handling_ok() checks that libusb is still happy for your
 *    thread to be performing event handling. Sometimes, libusb needs to
 *    interrupt the event handler, and this is how you can check if you have
 *    been interrupted. If this function returns 0, the correct behaviour is
 *    for you to give up the event handling lock, and then to repeat the cycle.
 *    The following libusb_try_lock_events() will fail, so you will become an
 *    events waiter. For more information on this, read \ref fullstory below.
 * -# libusb_handle_events_locked() is a variant of
 *    libusb_handle_events_timeout() that you can call while holding the
 *    events lock. libusb_handle_events_timeout() itself implements similar
 *    logic to the above, so be sure not to call it when you are
 *    "working behind libusb's back", as is the case here.
 * -# libusb_event_handler_active() determines if someone is currently
 *    holding the events lock
 *
 * You might be wondering why there is no function to wake up all threads
 * blocked on libusb_wait_for_event(). This is because libusb can do this
 * internally: it will wake up all such threads when someone calls
 * libusb_unlock_events() or when a transfer completes (at the point after its
 * callback has returned).
 *
 * \subsection fullstory The full story
 *
 * The above explanation should be enough to get you going, but if you're
 * really thinking through the issues then you may be left with some more
 * questions regarding libusb's internals. If you're curious, read on, and if
 * not, skip to the next section to avoid confusing yourself!
 *
 * The immediate question that may spring to mind is: what if one thread
 * modifies the set of file descriptors that need to be polled while another
 * thread is doing event handling?
 *
 * There are 2 situations in which this may happen.
 * -# libusb_open() will add another file descriptor to the poll set,
 *    therefore it is desirable to interrupt the event handler so that it
 *    restarts, picking up the new descriptor.
 * -# libusb_close() will remove a file descriptor from the poll set. There
 *    are all kinds of race conditions that could arise here, so it is
 *    important that nobody is doing event handling at this time.
 *
 * libusb handles these issues internally, so application developers do not
 * have to stop their event handlers while opening/closing devices. Here's how
 * it works, focusing on the libusb_close() situation first:
 *
 * -# During initialization, libusb opens an internal pipe, and it adds the read
 *    end of this pipe to the set of file descriptors to be polled.
 * -# During libusb_close(), libusb writes some dummy data on this event pipe.
 *    This immediately interrupts the event handler. libusb also records
 *    internally that it is trying to interrupt event handlers for this
 *    high-priority event.
 * -# At this point, some of the functions described above start behaving
 *    differently:
 *   - libusb_event_handling_ok() starts returning 1, indicating that it is NOT
 *     OK for event handling to continue.
 *   - libusb_try_lock_events() starts returning 1, indicating that another
 *     thread holds the event handling lock, even if the lock is uncontended.
 *   - libusb_event_handler_active() starts returning 1, indicating that
 *     another thread is doing event handling, even if that is not true.
 * -# The above changes in behaviour result in the event handler stopping and
 *    giving up the events lock very quickly, giving the high-priority
 *    libusb_close() operation a "free ride" to acquire the events lock. All
 *    threads that are competing to do event handling become event waiters.
 * -# With the events lock held inside libusb_close(), libusb can safely remove
 *    a file descriptor from the poll set, in the safety of knowledge that
 *    nobody is polling those descriptors or trying to access the poll set.
 * -# After obtaining the events lock, the close operation completes very
 *    quickly (usually a matter of milliseconds) and then immediately releases
 *    the events lock.
 * -# At the same time, the behaviour of libusb_event_handling_ok() and friends
 *    reverts to the original, documented behaviour.
 * -# The release of the events lock causes the threads that are waiting for
 *    events to be woken up and to start competing to become event handlers
 *    again. One of them will succeed; it will then re-obtain the list of poll
 *    descriptors, and USB I/O will then continue as normal.
 *
 * libusb_open() is similar, and is actually a more simplistic case. Upon a
 * call to libusb_open():
 *
 * -# The device is opened and a file descriptor is added to the poll set.
 * -# libusb sends some dummy data on the event pipe, and records that it
 *    is trying to modify the poll descriptor set.
 * -# The event handler is interrupted, and the same behaviour change as for
 *    libusb_close() takes effect, causing all event handling threads to become
 *    event waiters.
 * -# The libusb_open() implementation takes its free ride to the events lock.
 * -# Happy that it has successfully paused the events handler, libusb_open()
 *    releases the events lock.
 * -# The event waiter threads are all woken up and compete to become event
 *    handlers again. The one that succeeds will obtain the list of poll
 *    descriptors again, which will include the addition of the new device.
 *
 * \subsection concl Closing remarks
 *
 * The above may seem a little complicated, but hopefully I have made it clear
 * why such complications are necessary. Also, do not forget that this only
 * applies to applications that take libusb's file descriptors and integrate
 * them into their own polling loops.
 *
 * You may decide that it is OK for your multi-threaded application to ignore
 * some of the rules and locks detailed above, because you don't think that
 * two threads can ever be polling the descriptors at the same time. If that
 * is the case, then that's good news for you because you don't have to worry.
 * But be careful here; remember that the synchronous I/O functions do event
 * handling internally. If you have one thread doing event handling in a loop
 * (without implementing the rules and locking semantics documented above)
 * and another trying to send a synchronous USB transfer, you will end up with
 * two threads monitoring the same descriptors, and the above-described
 * undesirable behaviour occurring. The solution is for your polling thread to
 * play by the rules; the synchronous I/O functions do so, and this will result
 * in them getting along in perfect harmony.
 *
 * If you do have a dedicated thread doing event handling, it is perfectly
 * legal for it to take the event handling lock for long periods of time. Any
 * synchronous I/O functions you call from other threads will transparently
 * fall back to the "event waiters" mechanism detailed above. The only
 * consideration that your event handling thread must apply is the one related
 * to libusb_event_handling_ok(): you must call this before every poll(), and
 * give up the events lock if instructed.
